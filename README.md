# Alma 920 PowerShell Script

This Windows PowerShell script creates a text string for the Alma 920 field and copies the string to the clipboard for a user to paste in the Alma Metadata Editor. Harvard University libraries use this local MARC holdings field for recording cataloging statistics.

Documentation for this script and Houghton Library's 920 policy is on the Houghton Technical Services wiki:
